### Fonts

There were 3 fonts used in this project, as stated below:
- xxxxxxx with a backup of xxxxxx is the main font used throughout the website
- xxxxxx with a backup of xxxxxx was used for the button styles
- xxxxxx with a backup of xxxxxxx was used for the (any other styles ie the counters numbers)

### Structure

The website's structure was carefully constructed with making it recognizable, user friendly and simple kept in mind. On arrival to the website the user will be presented with a notification that indicates click to play and a navigation bar which is uniform across all pages. The website is made of one main page, a 404 page and 4 modals:

- A homepage, with links to the key sections of the site
- An about page, which describes a brief history of the business, has customer reviews and as news section
- A menu page, which lists all drinks available
- A gallery page, which consists of a showcase of images
- A 404 page, which will allow the user to navigate back to the main site.

### Wireframes

## Features

In its entirety the website consists of five main pages, one 404 error page and 16 features, two of which have a mobile version and tablet/desktop version. 

### Existing features

#### Nav Bar 

The navigation bar is featured on the main page and the error 404 page. It includes 4 clickable modals:

Other features of the Nav Bar include:

- It is fully responsive due to using the Bootstrap v5.0.2 nav bar which then produces a toggler menu for smaller screens. 
- A hover effect on the text of the navigation bar text allows the user to understand that it is a clickable link. Upon clicking the link the user will be taken to the desired page

- Covered in user story: xx

##### Desktop

### CSS Validation

[W3C Jigsaw CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate the CSS used in the website. The file passed and produced no errors if testing my own CSS however it did produce some warnings which are related to Bootstrap 5.0.2

### Accessibility

- Icons from Font Awesome are used in the site. As they are for decorative purposes only, Font Awesome already populates the code to be copied with an aria-hidden="true" attribute to accommodate accessibility.

### Performance

[Chrome dev tools lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) was used to test all pages for performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO

- Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro
- Windows 10 PC with a 24" MSI Curved gaming monitor

In addition to testing on physical devices, the site was also tested using Google Chrome Developer Tools pre-defined devices and also the responsive mode in which I would slowly increase the width of the screen to ensure responsiveness worked across all display sizes.

### Browser Compatibility

The website was tested on the following web browsers:
- Google Chrome Version 101.0.4951.67
- DuckDuckGo

## Deployment

### Github Pages

This project was deployed to GitHub pages in the project's early stages to allow continual responsive testing. This was achieved via the following steps:

1. Navigate to www.github.com and log in.
2. Once logged in navigate to the projects [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jkingportfolio/CI_PP1_TheCocktailBar)
3. Click on the settings button at the top right corner of the repository.
4. Select Pages from the left hand side menu.
5. For the source, select Branch:Master and click save.
6. The webpage will refresh automatically displaying a message at the top of the ribbon stating "Your site is publish at https://jkingportfolio.github.io/CI_PP1_TheCocktailBar/
7. The site is now live online and can be viewed by anyone.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

We can make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view or make changes too without affecting the original repository, this is known as forking. Forking in GitHub can be done via the following steps:

1. Navigate to www.github.com and log in.
2. Once logged in navigate to the desired [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jkingportfolio/CI_PP1_TheCocktailBar) that you would like to fork.
3. At the top right corner of the page click on the fork icon.
4. There should now be a copy of your original repository in your Github account.

Please note if you are not a member of an organisation on GitHub then you will not be able to fork your own repository.

### Clone a GitHub Repository

You can make a local clone of a repository via the following steps: 

1. Navigate to www.github.com and log in.
2. Once logged in navigate to the desired [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jkingportfolio/CI_PP1_TheCocktailBar) that you would like to clone.
3. Locate the code button at the top, above the repository file structure.
4. Select the prefered clone method from HTTPS. SSH or GitHub CLI then click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard.
5. Open Git Bash
6. Update the current working direction to the location in which you would like the clone directory to be created.
7. Type `git clone` and paste the previously copied URL at Step 4.
8. `$ clone https://github.com/jkingportfolio/CI_PP1_TheCocktailBar`
9. Now press enter and the local clone will be created at the desired local location
